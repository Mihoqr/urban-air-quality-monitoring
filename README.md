# Urban Air Quality Monitoring

This project simulates air quality sensor data in an urban setting. It uses Python to generate values like PM2.5, CO2, temperature, humidity, and AQI. The goal is to show how IoT devices might collect this kind of data in real life.

## Project Info
- Subject: Application Development and Emerging Technologies
- Name: Michelle Joi Quesada
        Dennis Myles San Pascual
- Date: May 2025

## What the Code Does
The script randomly creates 100 data records with:
- Timestamp (within the last 24 hours)
- Station ID (A, B, or C)
- PM2.5
- CO2
- Temperature
- Humidity
- AQI

## Files
- `generate_air_quality_data.py`: Python script that creates the data
- `urban_air_quality_data.csv`: The output as a spreadsheet
- `urban_air_quality_data.json`: The same output but in JSON format
